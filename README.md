# PhatDeck

PhatDeck is a web app that allows the user to draw a random card from a deck of cards.

It is written in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference). These where chosen to keep the scope of the project limited.

I had to develop a good understanding of multidimensional arrays for this project.

## Why

Not only will PhatDeck be a core component of a future Solitaire game, but it also serves as a way of practicing the skills that I have learned.

## Features

- Both light and dark themes
- A shuffle button
- An animated card draw

## Installation

Open the app in a browser.

## To do List

1. connect all the classes to its responding style (continuing) ✅
2. clean up CSS duplications if there is any ✅
3. make sure the JS file has its updated class that has its conflicts (currently) ✅
4. compare the backup.html and backup.css if there is any missing style/options required.
